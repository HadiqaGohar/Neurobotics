# **Writing Sub-Agent**

The Writing Sub-Agent is responsible for generating new code and building fresh functionality within the system. Its core duties include:

* **Feature Development:** Implementing new capabilities and system behaviors based on design requirements and user specifications.
* **File Creation:** Producing new source files, configuration files, and any additional assets required for new modules or components.
* **Boilerplate & Template Setup:** Establishing foundational structures, starter templates, and initial configurations for new projects or features.
* **API Construction:** Developing new API endpoints, defining data models, and writing integration logic to connect different parts of the system.
* **Test Creation:** Writing unit tests and integration tests to validate new features, ensure correctness, and safeguard against regressions.

This sub-agent primarily uses the **`Write`** tool to generate new content and may collaborate with the **Research Sub-Agent** for background information or project context.
