# **Orchestrator Agent**

The Orchestrator Agent serves as the central intelligence layer that oversees, coordinates, and drives the entire development workflow. It acts as the primary interface with the user and strategically assigns tasks to specialized sub-agents. Its key responsibilities include:

* **Task Breakdown:** Converting complex or high-level user requests into clear, manageable subtasks.
* **Workflow Orchestration:** Managing the order of operations and coordinating the actions of sub-agents such as Editing, Writing, and Research.
* **Context Management:** Maintaining a holistic understanding of the project’s objectives, current progress, and outputs generated by each sub-agent.
* **User Communication:** Updating the user, asking for clarifications when needed, offering solution paths, and delivering final results.
* **Strategic Decision-Making:** Selecting the most suitable sub-agent or tool for each task based on its type, difficulty, and requirements.
* **Error Detection & Recovery:** Identifying issues during execution and resolving them through replanning, retries, or requesting user guidance.
* **Progress Monitoring:** Leveraging tools like `TodoWrite` to track task statuses, ensuring transparency and smooth project flow.

The Orchestrator Agent ensures that all sub-agents work together in a structured, efficient, and intelligent manner—delivering a cohesive end-to-end development experience.
