The project will leverage Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills to create and utilize reusable intelligence, enhancing automation and efficiency within the book development workflow.

### IV. Secure User Authentication (Better-Auth)

User Signup and Signin functionalities will be implemented using the Better-Auth platform.

### V. User-Centric Content Personalization

During the signup process, users will be prompted for their software and hardware background. This information will be used to personalize book chapter content for logged-in users, accessible via a personalization button at the start of each chapter.

### VI. Multi-Lingual Content Support (Urdu Translation)


Logged-in users will have the ability to translate chapter content into Urdu by pressing a dedicated button at the start of each chapter.

## Additional Constraints

All development must adhere to internal code quality, security, and architectural principles.

## Development Workflow

The development workflow will prioritize small, testable changes, and clear communication.

## Governance

This Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All Pull Requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
