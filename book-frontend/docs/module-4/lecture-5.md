# Lecture 5: Machine Learning for Robotics

## Introduction to ML in Robotics

**Machine Learning** transforms robots from pre-programmed machines into adaptive, intelligent systems that can learn from experience, generalize to new situations, and improve their performance over time.

## Key Takeaways

- Machine learning enables robots to adapt, learn from experience, and improve performance
- Supervised learning is effective for perception tasks like object recognition and pose estimation
- Unsupervised learning helps with anomaly detection and discovering patterns in sensor data
- Reinforcement learning allows robots to learn optimal control policies through interaction
- Imitation learning enables robots to learn complex behaviors from expert demonstrations
- Continual learning allows robots to acquire new skills while preserving previous knowledge
- Safety constraints are crucial when applying ML to physical robot systems
- Online adaptation enables robots to adjust to changing environments and conditions
- Proper evaluation and validation are essential for deploying ML models on robots
- The combination of different learning approaches often yields the best results
